    <h2 class="story">LET US TELL YOU A STORY.<br>LET IT BE OUR BRAND'S STORY</h2>
    <p class="hh animate__animated animate__backInLeft">At Cosmetic Private Limited, we believe in leading<br>
        revolutions that benefit our people and the planet.
        After<br> witnessing the ambiguity, greenwashing, and misinformation<br> surrounding the personal care
        industry, we
        understood the<br> need for a shift in the narrative of how consumers perceive<br> the industry and its
        products. The
        outcome of this<br> understanding is the brand cosmetic: an ambitious initiative that<br> champions healthy,
        natural, and
        chemical-less products. The<br> brainchild of Ms. Taapsee Pannu and<br> Ms. Jessie
        Vijay
        Sethupathi, our vision is to nurture cosmetic into<br> a brand synonymous with the goodness of Mother Nature
        and<br> her
        timeless gifts. ‘cosmetic,’ means ‘beauty,’ is a powerful blend<br> of nature and tradition, put together by
        passionate
        people,<br> who wish to empower consumers with confidence and vitality.</p>

    <p class="oo animate__animated animate__backInRight">Cosmetics was founded with a creative vision to fill the gap
        between<br> makeup artistry and fashion photography.
        Long before their company<br> history, cosmetics founders directed their product line towards<br> professionals
        in
        the beauty and fashion industry who had to rely on heavy<br> cosmetics, cake makeup and stage makeup to create
        the
        visual effects needed<br> to withstand bright lighting during photo shoots.cosmetics was founded with a creative

        that all pains have gains. M.A.CAIDSFUND.ORG<br> was launched in 1994, supporting men, women, and children
        affected<br>
        by AIDS/HIV globally. M.A.C. introduced the ""Kid's helping Kids""<br> which, with the sale of greeting cards,
        painted by the kids, will be<br> donated to pediatric organizations.</p>

    <h2 class="we">In Nature, We Trust</h2>
    <p class="ff">The principle behind cosmetics is utilizing centuries-old (not-so-secret) ingredients and
        processes<br> passed
        down through generations. We redefine traditional recipes to resolve present-day health and<br> wellness
        concerns,
        by providing emphasis on the benefits of the resources offered by Mother Nature.
        <br><br>
        We also believe that the effectiveness of developing products that stem from naturally-rooted ingredients<br>
        far
        surpasses chemical based competitors. Our process brings out the authentic essence of natural ingredients<br>
        ensures optimal results through regular use, and facilitates a rejuvenating experience for the mind, body, and
        spirit.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h2 class="sour">Ethically Sourced</h2>
    <p class="gg">At my cosmetics, we strive to be torchbearers of authenticity and purity without an ounce of
        pretentiousness.<br>
        We ensure the high-pure organic and value-added agricultural ingredients are sustainably sourced from
        the<br>
        farmlands. We also actively advocate the need for more personal care products free of cruelty, harmful<br>
        <br>
        chemicals, and additives, – akin to our own range.
        Following an extensive expert research and development<br> process, the manufacturing of all cosmetics involves
        natural and traditional methods to extract the<br> benefits and essence, a feat rarely seen in the global
        personal
        care industry.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h2 class="made">Made in small batches</h2>
    <p class="uu">Cosmetics aims to preserve the authenticity of our products and packaging in a move that enables us to
        prevent<br> mass production and the eventual possibility of a compromise in the quality. We are a team that
        believe
        in ‘quality<br> over quantity’ any day and prepare our products in small, fresh batches to retain the essence of
        goodness.<br>
        <br>
        This initiative branches from our belief that little things can make great differences. We hope to
        emulate the compassion<br> of Mother Nature by producing in small batches with love and satisfying our
        consumers’
        personal care needs.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h2 class="for">Specifically curated for today's ecosystem</h2>
    <p class="my">My cosmetics products are made with homegrown ingredients to benefit the consumers and the community at large.<br> We hope
        to strike a consistent balance between the regions’ climate and our product range by taking geo-specific<br>
        measures in the curation process.<br>
        <br>
        All our products cater to and address the intense effects the humid weather can have on the hair of our
        consumers.</p>
